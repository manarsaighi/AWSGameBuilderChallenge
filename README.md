# DevPost Project Brief:

Join us for the AWS Game Builder Challenge! In the challenge, you are tasked with creating an innovative game that shows your creativity, originality, and utilization of AWS services. All skill levels are welcome and you can work alone or as a part of a team.

Use Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI-powered assistant, to build your game faster. Then, use other AWS services of your choosing in your game: for example AWS Amplify Hosting to deploy a web-based game, Amazon S3 for storing game assets, Amazon DynamoDB to store game data, or Amazon Bedrock to add generative AI capabilities. 

The AWS Game Builder Challenge gives you the chance to showcase your skills, learn from others, and create something fun to play! So get ready to code, compete, and have a great time doing it!
